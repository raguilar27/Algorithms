		 *  Despite its designation as an anti-materiel rifle, it is used by some armed forces as an anti-personnel system.
		 *  The M107 variant is also called the Light Fifty for its .50 BMG (12.7ï¿½99mm NATO) chambering and significantly lighter weight compared to previous applications and the 15% heavier base M82 model.
		 *  [1][2] The weapon is found in three variants, the original M82A1 (and A3), the bullpup M82A2 and Barrett M107A1 with muzzle brake designed to accept a suppressor and made out of titanium instead of steel. 
		 *  The M82A2 is no longer manufactured, though the XM500 can be seen as its successor.
